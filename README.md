# BAIS-week7-HW

The purpose of this project was to create a survey by linking different html files and creating different forms.

The form I have created represents the best practice of html. The first function I used that represents this is autofocus. This function allows users to type and press tab to get to the next input without having to move their cursor. This makes this more convenient for users. 

I made 4 different pages with short answers and questions instead of less pages with more questions. This reduces the cognitive load on users and makes it easier to  process each question. Another thing I added was the page number out of the total page numbers of the survey. I did this to allow users to know where they are within the survey while taking it. This is a process indicator and lets them know how much time they have left.

I added many options for the question where I asked the gender of the user. I added male, female, prefer not to answer, and another option with a test input box so the user can fill out how they identify. This ensures that no users are uncomfortable taking this survey adn everyone is accounted for. If users do not feel comfortable answering this question, they are able to click prefer not to answer and move on with the survey.
